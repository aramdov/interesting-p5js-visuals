# Creative p5js visualizations

This repository contains a collection of creative visualizations made with p5js.

## To see the visualizations in your browser.
Copy code from the `*.js` files and paste it into the p5js web editor at https://editor.p5js.org/.

## List of active prompts and their respective visualizations that I am exploring.

1.	Climate Tech Twist
“Create something I can paste into p5.js that simulates a futuristic climate monitoring dashboard, complete with real-time visualizations of carbon emissions, weather patterns, and renewable energy outputs on a spinning 3D globe.”
2.	AI and Multi-Agent Systems
“Generate p5.js code that visualizes a hive of AI agents collaborating to solve a puzzle in real time, using glowing nodes and dynamic network connections to represent their interactions.”
3.	SolarPunk Aesthetic
“Create p5.js code that evokes a SolarPunk control panel for a self-sustaining eco-village, with organic shapes, flowing animations, and indicators for solar power, wind energy, and environmental health.”
4.	Game Theory Visualization
“Write p5.js code that visualizes an evolving game theory matrix, showing player strategies and outcomes dynamically as they adapt over time in a glowing futuristic grid.”
5.	Distributed Energy
“Generate p5.js code that visualizes a distributed energy grid, with nodes representing homes and solar panels, animated to show energy flows and battery storage dynamics in a futuristic interface.”
6.	Next-Gen Starship UI
“Create something I can paste into p5.js that replicates the UI of a starship’s next-gen navigation system, complete with zoomable star maps, real-time orbit simulations, and holographic-like effects.”
7.	Sensor Data Integration
“Generate p5.js code that visualizes environmental sensor data, like air quality, temperature, and humidity, in a creative way that feels like it belongs to a high-tech weather forecasting station.”
8.	Interactive Microservices Visualizer
“Create p5.js code for an interactive visualizer of microservices in a distributed system, showing connections, data flows, and bottlenecks with smooth animations and futuristic visuals.”
9.	Cyberpunk Energy Grid
“Write p5.js code that looks like a cyberpunk-style energy grid control interface, with glowing circuits, flickering lights, and animated power surges through the system.”
10.	Economics Simulation
“Generate p5.js code that visualizes a virtual economy in action, with animated trade flows, resource distributions, and agent interactions in a way that’s both insightful and aesthetically pleasing.”
